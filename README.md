**Welcome to the Broker Studios college project!**

### Project Structure
The repository is divided into 2 projects. The [`Broker`](https://github.com/OscarCaro/BrokerLand/blob/master/Broker) folder contains our project,  and the [`Wasteland-MUD`](https://github.com/OscarCaro/BrokerLand/blob/master/Wasteland-MUD) is an external project we took references from.

### Planning
We are following the agile methodologies. To have a look at our schedule and management, visit the [Projects Tab](https://github.com/OscarCaro/BrokerLand/projects). Also parts of the process were divided into sprints, the last of them is documented in the [Issues Tab](https://github.com/OscarCaro/BrokerLand/issues).

### User Stories
The Agile-development user stories have been compiled under the [User Stories](https://github.com/OscarCaro/BrokerLand/wiki/1.-User-Stories) tab on the wiki. Also the descriptive user stories can be found under the [Game Description](https://github.com/OscarCaro/BrokerLand/wiki/0.-Game-Description) tab on the wiki. They are also accesible inside the [`BrokerDocumentation`](https://github.com/OscarCaro/BrokerLand/blob/master/BrokerDocumentation) folder in their original format.

### Architecture
Find a specific explanation on how the code is organized in the [Architecture](https://github.com/OscarCaro/BrokerLand/wiki/2.-Architecture) dedicated part of the project wiki.

### Java Patterns + UML Diagrams
This project contains several standard **Java Patterns**. Find all the documentation and diagrams in the [Java Patterns](https://github.com/OscarCaro/BrokerLand/wiki/3.-Java-Patterns) tab on the wiki.
If you directly want to take a look at the **UML Diagrams**, they can be found in the [`BrokerDocumentation/ArchitectureAndPatterns/UML_Diagrams`](https://github.com/OscarCaro/BrokerLand/tree/master/BrokerDocumentation/ArchitectureAndPatterns/UML_Diagrams) folder.

### Testing
The development of the project has run its course using testing techniques. To get more information about it, visit the [Testing](https://github.com/OscarCaro/BrokerLand/wiki/4.-JUnit-Tests) tab. Also you can check out [`Broker/src/tests`](https://github.com/OscarCaro/BrokerLand/blob/master/Broker/src/tests) folder to take a look at them and run them if you desire.

### Execution
There are several ways to run the game depending on the argument input. Thus making it possible to access various difficuly levels or, with specific inputs, creating a custom game. To learn more about them, visit the [Execution](https://github.com/OscarCaro/BrokerLand/wiki/5.-Execution) tab of the wiki, which not only explains how to use the arguments but also offers directions to our tutorial video.

The studio hopes you enjoy the depicted broker lifestyle our project offers, and that the documentation is clear and organised enough to your taste!
