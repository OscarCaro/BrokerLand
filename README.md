**Welcome to the Broker Studios college project!**

### Project Structure
The repository is divided into 2 projects. The [`Broker`](https://github.com/UCM-FDI-IS2-2020/se2-project-broker-studios/blob/master/Broker) folder contains our project,  and the [`Wasteland-MUD`](https://github.com/UCM-FDI-IS2-2020/se2-project-broker-studios/blob/master/Wasteland-MUD) is an external project we took references from.

### Planning
We are following the agile methodologies. To have a look at our schedule and management, visit the [Projects Tab](https://github.com/UCM-FDI-IS2-2020/se2-project-broker-studios/projects). Also parts of the process were divided into sprints, the last of them is documented in the [Issues Tab](https://github.com/UCM-FDI-IS2-2020/se2-project-broker-studios/issues).

### User Stories
The user stories have been compiled under the [User Stories](https://github.com/UCM-FDI-IS2-2020/se2-project-broker-studios/wiki/1.-User-Stories) tab on the wiki. And are also accesible inside the [`BrokerDocumentation`](https://github.com/UCM-FDI-IS2-2020/se2-project-broker-studios/blob/master/BrokerDocumentation) folder in their original format.

### Architecture
Find a specific explanation on how the code is organized in the [Architecture](https://github.com/UCM-FDI-IS2-2020/se2-project-broker-studios/wiki/2.-Architecture) dedicated part of the project wiki.

### Java Patterns + UML Diagrams
This project contains several standard **Java Patterns**. Find all the documentation and diagrams in the [Java Patterns](https://github.com/UCM-FDI-IS2-2020/se2-project-broker-studios/wiki/3.-Java-Patterns) tab on the wiki.
If you directly want to take a look at the **UML Diagrams**, they can be found in the [`BrokerDocumentation/ArchitectureAndPatterns/UML_Diagrams`](https://github.com/UCM-FDI-IS2-2020/se2-project-broker-studios/tree/master/BrokerDocumentation/ArchitectureAndPatterns/UML_Diagrams) folder.

### Testing
The development of the project has run its course using testing techniques. To get more information about it, visit the [Testing](https://github.com/UCM-FDI-IS2-2020/se2-project-broker-studios/wiki/4.-JUnit-Tests) tab. Also you can check out [`Broker/src/tests`](https://github.com/UCM-FDI-IS2-2020/se2-project-broker-studios/blob/master/Broker/src/tests) folder to take a look at them and run them if you desire.

### Execution
There are several ways to run the game depending on the argument input. Thus making it possible to access various difficuly levels or, with specific inputs, creating a custom game. To learn more about them, visit the [Execution](https://github.com/UCM-FDI-IS2-2020/se2-project-broker-studios/wiki/5.-Execution) tab of the wiki.

The studio hopes you enjoy the depicted broker lifestyle our project offers, and that the documentation is clear and organised enough to your taste!
